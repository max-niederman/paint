# Paint

Paint is an alternative client for [Canvas](https://canvas.instructure.com), a popular [Learning Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system).

This was an independent project for my high-school programming class, and is technically usable. However, I've gotten really bored with the project so I don't plan on adding any new features in the foreseeable future.

You can try it out [here](https://paint.maxniederman.com).
